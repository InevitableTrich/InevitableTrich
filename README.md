### Michael Oltman
I started coding at age 10, when I joined the Robotics team in the middle school. Since then, I have always loved coding and have almost always had some side project I have been working on. I have created basic games, such as card game simulators, a website to track spells for 5th edition Dungeons and Dragons, a Discord bot for a mobile game, Minecraft mods and much more. Languages I have leaned throughout my practice include Python, Java, JavaScript, CSS, HTML, C and C++, and other skills learned include using AWS, MongoDB, GoogleTests, GitHub (clearly), and Discord API.

I am currently enhancing my coding skills at University of Illinois at Chicago, where I work on projects with strict deadlines, learn new languages such as C and C++, and learn more about making cleaner, more efficient code.

My active project is a game built completely from scratch with only a graphics library and no game engine, coded entirely in C++.
